## Introduction
Welcome to the OrangeHRM Manual Testing Readme! This document provides a brief overview of how manual testing will be conducted for OrangeHRM using an Excel file to document test cases and test execution. Additionally, a test plan has been created to guide the testing process.

## Test Plan
A comprehensive test plan has been prepared to outline the scope, objectives, and approach for manual testing. It includes details about the testing environment, test data, test deliverables, and the schedule for testing activities.

## Test Cases and Execution
Test cases have been designed to cover various functionalities of the OrangeHRM software. These test cases are documented in an Excel file and categorized based on different modules, such as login, employee information, leave management, attendance tracking, and performance evaluation.

For each test case, the following information is provided:
- Test Case ID
- Test Scenario
- Test Steps
- Expected Results
- Actual Results
- Pass/Fail Status

During the test execution phase, testers will perform the following steps:
1. Access the OrangeHRM application using the provided test environment.
2. Refer to the Excel file to identify the test case to be executed.
3. Follow the test steps and perform the test.
4. Record the observed results and compare them with the expected results.
5. Mark the test case as "Pass" if the actual results match the expected results; otherwise, mark it as "Fail."
